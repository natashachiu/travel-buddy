### Travel Buddy
You need TWO terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, cd into ```frontend```. Run ```npm install`` or yarn to install the dependencies. Then run ```npm start```, and go to localhost:5173 in your browser.

In the other terminal, cd into ```backend```. Run ```npm install``` or yarn to install the dependencies, then ```npm start``` or yarn start to launch the server. Run ```npm run local``` to run with nodemon.

In the browser, you can click on the button and see the data get loaded.
